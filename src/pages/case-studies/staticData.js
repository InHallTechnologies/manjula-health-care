            <p>The funny thing about your heart not being in your job is that your job finds a way to affect your heart anyway. When researchers looked at men who felt unfairly treated at work, those who kept their feelings inside had more than twice the risk of a heart attack as those who coped in other ways.</p>
            <p>We're not recommending that you yell at your boss or kick any dogs. Instead, find strategies that dissipate the anger. Don't wait. Anger and hostility can also cause high blood pressure and constrict your blood vessels, which can lead to problems, including impotence. (More than one-quarter of U.S. adults have prehypertension.</p>
            <p>If you're unable to tackle the problems with your manager, your HR department, or your colleagues, at least try these anger-management tools:</p>
            <ul><li><b>Do the opposite</b>. Instead of swearing at someone who cuts you off, consider that there might be a reason—maybe he just got a call that his wife is in labor. Don't use that finger; empathize with the poor guy about the 24,619 diapers he is going to have to change.</li>
            <li><b>Choose smart words</b>. Steer clear of words like "never" or "always." Statements like "This machine never works!" or "You're always forgetting things!" not only are inaccurate but also make you feel that your anger is justified because there's no way to solve the problem.</li>
            <li><b>Get real with your expectations</b>. Don't blame yourself for things that are out of your control, and don't blame your boss for things that are out of her control.</li></ul>

            <p>What does the shape of your hips or belly have to do with the health of your legs? Turns out, quite a bit.</p>
            <p>One study showed that during extended travel, pear-shaped women and apple-shaped men may have an increased risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) -- a dangerous clotting condition that often starts in the legs. But there are lots of things you can do about it.</p>
            <p><b>Go with the Flow</b></p>
            <p>If you suffer from poor circulation in your legs, try these simple healthy-leg strategies during long car, train, or plane rides, and reduce your risk of deep vein thrombosis:</p>
            <ul><li><b>Take a break.</b>. Get up, walk, and stretch your legs every hour or so if you can. If you have to remain seated, do ankle rolls, and alternately point and flex your toes 10 times every half hour.</li>
            <li><b>Take a drink.</b>. Keep the nonalcoholic fluids -- water, tea, etc. -- flowing, because dehydration ups the risk of deep vein thrombosis. </li>
            <li><b>Take it off</b>. Your belt, that is. Avoid tight clothing, and don't cross your legs. They can inhibit blood flow and cause poor circualtion.</li></ul>

            <p>Aromatherapy is a complementary treatment that uses essential oils to enhance relaxation and boost mental sharpness. If you love scents—concocted by distilling volatile oils from the flowers, leaves and bark of plants—you’ll enjoy the varied aromas that deliver aromatherapy’s message. By making sure you get only essential oils—many fragrant oils contain hormone-disrupting phthalates—you’ll get the aromas’ benefits without any downsides.</p>
            <p>But aromatherapy’s not a cure-all. Research tells us that good scents make sense when you need a little ‘nudge.’ Brown University researchers note in a review of 18 aromatherapy studies, “odors can affect mood, physiology and behavior”—most likely because the nerves that carry odor signals to your brain communicate directly with areas involved with emotion and learning. This may explain aromatherapy’s substantial effects, and the list is impressive:</p>
            <ul><li><b>Grapefruit squashes food cravings</b>. In a study from Japan’s Osaka University, the scent of a grapefruit’s essential oil reduced appetite.</li>
            <li><b>Neroli for calm</b>. The floral scent of neroli eased anxiety in a lab study at Japan’s Taichung Veterans General Hospital. Sniffing neroli temporarily lowered blood pressure and heart rate slightly in other research, too.</li>
            <li><b>Roses for deeper sleep</b>. Sniffing rose essential oil led to deeper, longer sleep in a research study from Japan’s Mie University Graduate School of Medicine.</li></ul>

        <p>If you have allergies, you’re not alone. More than 50 million Americans have allergies, making them the sixth most common cause of chronic illness. But it’s not enough to know that you’re one of millions who suffer. To treat allergies more effectively, you first need to know what is causing your allergic reactions. Allergy tests are quick and painless ways to find out. Here’s what you need to know about allergy tests before you head to the appointment.</p>
        <p><b>What allergies and allergy tests are</b></p>
        <p>Allergies are the immune system’s response to certain triggers, called allergens. There are a few types of allergies: seasonal allergies like pollen and some types of mold; perennial allergies, which are commonly caused by dust mites, and cat or dog hair; and food allergies. Wheat, eggs, milk, peanuts, tree nuts, soy, fish and shellfish are the most common sources for food allergies, but any food can be an allergen.</p>
        <p>If you want to know your specific allergens, you’ll need an allergy test. There are two types: skin tests and blood tests. “Both are equally valid and very good at detecting allergies, and, overall, are considered comparable tests,” says Christopher Webber, MD, an allergist with Sky Ridge Medical Center in Lone Tree, Colorado.</p>
        <p><b>How allergy tests are done</b></p>
        <p>Though both tests are simple and accurate, the blood test is more convenient. According to Dr. Webber, a blood test can be done in your primary doctor’s office at any time of the day, doesn’t require an empty stomach and you don’t need to stop taking allergy medications. The drawback is that the test results take longer to process: you’ll receive them within a week, says Webber.</p>
        <p>A skin test must be done at an allergist’s office, according to Weber, and you can’t take antihistamines for five to seven days before the test—but you’ll have results in about 20 minutes. Webber explains the process: an allergist will rub pieces of plastic that have been dipped in various allergens—foods, pet dander, or pollen from different trees, grasses, and weeds—on your back.</p>

        <p>At age 84, Sister Madonna Buder (aka The Iron Nun), finished Ironman Canada. How’d she do it? Sister Iron says, “…all I was concentrating on [was] getting the job done.”</p>
        <p>Single-mindedness is essential for endurance athletes—and also for you, as you walk 10,000 steps a day to strengthen your body and mind without the wear and tear of endurance sports. Plus, mental focus let’s you drive safely or read—and remember—a book on a crowded commuter train. But many folks say that over time, focus becomes difficult and they’re more easily distracted.</p>
        <p>Well, researchers measured the brain activity of volunteers 18 to 88 as they watched a movie and reacted to distractions. Turns out, as you age you notice and react to ever-more diverse sensory stimuli and that can blur your focus. Aging, said the researchers, makes your “experience of the world…increasingly individualistic,” differing from both younger folks and your peers as well.</p>
        <p>So how can you enjoy the benefits of expanding sensory awareness and hold onto the ability to focus sharply? Try this.</p>
        <ol><li>Reduce mind-clouding stress with mindful meditation 5 minutes every morning and evening.</li>
        <li>Do resistance training exercises for 30 minutes, three days a week.</li>
        <li>Practice attention training: Set up tasks that require you to tune into what you’re doing and tune out distractions (like reading while the TV is on or writing an email in a noisy room).</li></ol>
