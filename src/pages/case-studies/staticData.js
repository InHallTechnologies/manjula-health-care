            <p>"My heartbeats are heavy. It becomes difficult to catch my breath. My hands shake and get sweaty," said Aritri Paul of the terrifying panic attacks that strike more frequently since India went into coronavirus lockdown in March. </p>
            <p>India's government started easing the most severe restrictions on daily life in June, but the effects of the lockdown on residents' mental health are still emerging, as the country battles one of the most severe Covid-19 outbreaks in the world. India now has over 4.2 million cases of the virus, giving it the second-highest tally of recorded cases globally, only behind the Unites States.</p>
            <p>Research conducted by the Suicide Prevention in India Foundation (SPIF) in May found that nearly 65% of 159 mental health professionals surveyed reported an increase in self-harm among their patients. More than 85% of therapists surveyed said they were experiencing caregiver fatigue, and over 75% said fatigue had impacted their work.</p>
            <p>Before Covid-19, India had the highest suicide rate in south-east Asia -- now medical experts say the country's mental health system is being pushed to the limit.</p>
            <p>"The system was already creaking and overburdened, now with Covid, we are experiencing the catastrophe of increased demand, woeful supply, and fatigued frontline workers," said Nelson Moses, founder of SPIF.</p>
            <br/>
            <h3>No words for mental health</h3>
            <p>In 2016, a National Mental Health Survey conducted across 12 states documented a list of over 50 derogatory terms used for people suffering mental illness. "Usually, the public believes that individuals with psychiatric illnesses are incompetent, irrational and untrustworthy consequently, they have low marriage opportunities," said one of the participants.</p>
            <p>"People think that talking about your feelings makes you weak -- there are a lot of misconceptions," said 23-year-old Baldev Singh, a volunteer counselor with the MINDS Foundation, an Indian nonprofit that aims to reduce the stigma around mental health.</p>
            <p>Experts say the historical reluctance to address mental health in India could be partly due to a lack of terminology. None of India's 22 languages have words that mean "mental health" or "depression."</p>
            <br/>
            <h3>Straining mental health system</h3>
            <p>The stigma around mental health may prevent some people from recognizing that they need help. For those who do want treatment, facilities are limited.</p>
            <p>According to the 2016 National Mental Health Survey, 83% of people suffering mental health problems in India did not have access to adequate mental health treatment. </p>
            <p>The same year, India had three psychiatrists for every million people and even fewer psychologists, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). For comparison, the US had 100 psychiatrists and almost 300 psychologists for every million people.</p>
            <br/>
            <h3>The urban-rural divide</h3>        
            <p>India was heading into harvest season when the government announced its nationwide lockdown in March. Farmers were confused about whether they could hire migrant workers amid the ban on cross-border movement, and whether crops could be transported to market, said Singh, the volunteer counselor. </p>
            <p>Technology has become crucial to mental health intervention in many communities during the pandemic. However, online therapy is not often available to people in villages who don't have access to smartphones or the internet. </p>
            <br/>
            <h3>Government programs</h3>
            <p>Changing attitudes in a country of 1.3 billion people is an immense challenge. But in recent months, there have been signs of change.</p>
            <p>Chaturvedi, from NIMHANS, is part of a central government initiative to address the mental health of migrants who were disproportionately affected by the lockdown that stretched for 68 days.</p>
            <p>Under the direction of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, NIMHANS set up a helpline that refers prospective patients to mental health professionals. Separately, the government released guidelines on addressing the mental health issues of migrants and health care workers, and advice on identifying patients whose mental health had suffered during the pandemic. And the Health Ministry shared posters stressing the importance of wellness practices, such as yoga to improve mental health.</p>

            <p>Postpartum depression (PPD) is clinical depression that occurs following childbirth. It is characterized by symptoms that include sadness, irritability, difficulty bonding with your baby, insomnia, and loss of appetite. While it can be very serious, it is treatable and very common. In fact, the Centers for Disease Control Prevention report that approximately 1 in 8 women experience postpartum depression.</p>
            <br/>
            <h3>Symptoms</h3>
            <p>The symptoms of postpartum depression are similar to a major depressive episode. In the "Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders" (DSM-5), the description of postpartum major depression is a "major depressive episode with a peripartum-onset specifier." Postpartum depression tends to develop within several weeks of delivery.</p>
            <p>Some experts feel the criteria to qualify for postpartum-onset should extend longer, perhaps up to six months after childbirth. Symptoms of PPD may include the following:</p>
            <ul><li>Change in weight or appetite</li>
            <li>Crying</li>
            <li>Depressed mood, loss of interest or pleasure</li>
            <li>Difficulty making decisions</li>
            <li>Feelings of inadequacy</li>
            <li>Feelings of worthlessness or guilt</li>
            <li>Insomnia or hypersomnia</li>
            <li>Loss of energy or fatigue</li>
            <li>Problems with concentration</li>
            <li>Restlessness or agitation</li>
            <li>Sadness</li></ul>
            <p>Some women also experience suicidal thoughts.</p>

            <p>Having a baby is a monumental, transformative moment in life. Your body has just spent nine months growing and gestating new life, which is no small task and can take a major toll on your body and mind. You labored and birthed your baby, which is one of the most intense physical experiences your body will ever endure.</p>
            <p>Then, suddenly, you have a baby, and even if your baby is everything you ever dreamed of, it’s a huge change to welcome a new baby into your life—not to mention the fact that you are likely functioning on very little sleep, your hormones are ebbing and flowing all over the place, your eating habits have likely changed drastically, and your emotional state is rapidly adjusting to the reality of parenting your baby.</p>
            <p>This mood shift, usually referred to as postpartum blues or “the baby blues,” is very common. In fact, the majority of mothers experience it. Still, as common as it is, many mothers wonder if what they're experiencing is normal and how best to cope with it. What's more, mothers frequently wonder if what they are experiencing is just the baby blues or a more serious mental health issue like postpartum depression.</p>

            <p>Every new mom experiences postpartum blues in their own way, but there are some symptoms that are common, such as:</p>
            <ul><li>Anxiety</li>
            <li>Experiencing sudden waves of sadness</li>
            <li>Exhaustion</li>
            <li>Feeling cranky or “off”</li>
            <li>Feeling generally overwhelmed</li>
            <li>Feeling joy one minute and sadness the next</li>
            <li>Feeling uncertain about your ability to care for your baby</li>
            <li>Impatience</li>
            <li>Irritability and grumpiness</li>
            <li>Seeming to cry over even the littlest things</li>
            <li>Trouble concentrating</li>
            <li>Trouble eating</li>
            <li>Trouble making decisions</li>
            <li>Trouble settling to sleep, even when you have time for it</li></ul>
            <br/>
            <h3>How Long Do the “Baby Blues” Last?</h3>
            <p>One of the most important distinctions between the “baby blues” and postpartum mood disorders like postpartum depression, anxiety, and psychosis, is that the “baby blues” are temporary. Here’s what we know about how long the “baby blues” lasts and what it means when your symptoms persist beyond this timeframe:</p>
            <ul><li>Some women only experience postpartum blues for the first few days after giving birth.</li>
            <li>Symptoms may peak at about four or five days after giving birth.</li>
            <li>For some women, postpartum blues last up to two weeks after giving birth.</li>
            <li>Experiencing symptoms that last up to two weeks is considered normal.</li></ul>
            <p>Symptoms that last more than two weeks, on the other hand, might signal that you have developed a postpartum mood disorder, and it’s worth discussing any concerns with your healthcare provider.</p>

            <p>Just because postpartum blues are normal and symptoms are generally mild and temporary doesn’t mean that it’s easy to endure. Here’s how to cope if your postpartum blues are bringing you down:</p>
            <ul><li>Assure yourself that what you are feeling is normal and has been experienced by almost all new mommies.</li>
            <li>Talk about your feelings with a trusted loved one.</li>
            <li>Join a new mom’s support group or connect online with other moms.</li>
            <li>Remember that there is no shame in asking for help with housework and meal prep.</li>
            <li>Get outside at least once a day, even if all you do is walk around the block a few times.</li>
            <li>Make sleep a priority in whatever way you can, whether that means sleeping when the baby sleeps or having your partner, family member, or other helper hold your baby for an hour while you doze on the couch.</li>
            <li>Cut yourself a lot of slack when it comes to chores and general upkeep of your house; you just had a baby and you can’t expect to do it all.</li>
            <li>Limit visitors or other stressful situations.</li>
            <li>Try to eat regularly; make sure you are getting adequate protein and are eating easily digestible foods.</li></ul>
